# Turf Chatroom application

**Turfee** is more than just a turf booking application — it introduces a built-in **Chatroom feature** to solve a common issue in team sports. Often, booked teams find themselves short on players at the last minute, which disrupts the game or leads to cancellations. Turfee solves this by allowing users to create chatrooms specifying turf location, date, time, and price when they need extra players. These chatrooms are visible to all users, enabling solo players or users without teams to join upcoming matches. This feature not only helps teams avoid playing short-handed or cancelling but also builds a community where users can connect, coordinate, and enjoy the game together — even if they’ve never met before.
